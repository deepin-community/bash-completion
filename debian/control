Description: programmable completion for the bash shell
 bash completion extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve
 complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  This project was
 conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most
 common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
 and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
